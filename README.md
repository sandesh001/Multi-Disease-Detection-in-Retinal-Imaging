## Dataset

The new Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD) consists of 3200 fundus images and contains 46 retinal conditions including various rare and challenging to detect diseases. The dataset was published associated to the Retinal Image Analysis for Multi-Disease Classification (RIADD) challenge from the ISBI 2021. The aim was to multi-label classify different sized retinal microscrope images.
